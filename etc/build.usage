        -x                      Set the xtrace sh(1)ell option for debugging purposes.
        -4|-6                   Force IPv[46] when downloading files.
        -a nt32|nt64            Selects 32-bit or 64-bit architecture; defaults to nt64.
        -b debug|release        Selects debug or release build; defaults to debug.
        -c                      Clean ${PREFIX} before processing build scripts.
        -C                      Check package(s) for updates upstream.

        -i                      Ignore SHA256 hash mismatches when downloading files.
        -N                      Offline mode: no {wget,git-{clone,pull}}(1) calls.
        -r package[,...][:step] Restart the specified comma-separated build(s) completely or at
                                the optionally specified step. Currently defined steps are:
                                fetch extract build_dir patch_pre autoconf patch configure clean
                                build install.
        -R                      Ignore build failures and continue building (relaxed mode.)
        -t[.gz|.bz2|.xz]        Produce binary distribution and source tarballs containing ${PREFIX}

                                level regular files at the end of a build with zero failures. The
                                tarballs will be compressed with either gzip, bzip2, or xz and signed
                                with GPG; the default compression is xz.
        -v                      Be verbose.
        --debug-minipix         Don't strip(1) minipix binaries to facilitate debugging minipix.
        <target>[ ...]          One of:
                                host_toolchain, native_toolchain, runtime, host_packages,

                                dev, or world.

        ${HOME}/midipix_build.vars, ../midipix_build.vars, and build.vars are sourced
        if they exist.

        Packages that are built by pkg.build will apply local patches in ${WORKDIR}
        named ${PKG_SUBDIR}.local.patch.

        Examples:
        ./build.sh -r coreutils
        Completely restart the coreutils build.

        ./build.sh -r coreutils:configure,build,install
        Restart the configure, build, and install steps of the coreutils build.

        ./build.sh -r psxscl GITROOT_HEAD=... PKG_PSXSCL_CFLAGS_CONFIGURE_EXTRA=-DPSX_INTERNAL_STRACE
        Build psxscl from the internal repository with strace enabled.

        ./build.sh -c -r ALL GITROOT_HEAD=...
        Clean ${PREFIX} and forcibly rebuild everything.
